## Motivation

- To master the use of the MERN stack and 
- Learn how to work and collaborate within a team on GitHub
- To learn how to develop a software by following a specified set of requirments
- To develope a full website.


## Build Status
There were some problems with the project that you might encouter while working with the system. These problems are:
- For an instructor and a corporate trainee they cannot forget password, as they won't be having an email in the system.
-  Adminstrators cannot login to the system.
-  After a trainee rates a course, the rating won't be shown on the course's card or page.
-  If you didn't complete all of the signing up field, you wont see an error message, and you will be navigated to the login page giving the feeling of actuallu signing up.
-  Corporate trainees can request a course more than once and the request will be created multiple times and shown to the admin as multiple requests, and if accepted, the course will be shown on their profile multiple times.
-  When an admin creates a user password, it is shown on the page what the password will be.
-  Country selection doesnot show the currently selected country, but it changes the currency to the currently selected country.
-  Individual trainees can buy the course more the once, and it will be shown on their profile more than once.
-  Individual trainees can request a refund on the course and then access the content of the course while still waiting for the refund.





## Code Style

We used Model–View–Controller (MVC) which is a software architectural pattern, where we divide the code into Model which is the database schemas, View which is the frontend pages and components where all frontend is rendered and Controller which has all the methods and functions used connected with all the routes needed. We used prettier which is an opinionated code formatter, it enforces a consistent style by parsing the code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account and wrapping code when necessary. Our naming convention was using names that uniquely identify the variable and/or the method while using also the Camel Case naming convention.
